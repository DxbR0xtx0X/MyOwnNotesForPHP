// adding (ing) or ... that what we call it casting 
// in this video we will ... how to convert data by our selves
//  so now we need to casting
// to do that we need to add the key of the data type
echo 1 + (int) "1 just an e.g"; /* the result here is 2 without any warning */
// here we say the second part is an integer don't work with him as a string and give us warning
// we can write anything have a realation with our value
// for e.g (int) or (integer) or we have the full control
echo 1 + (integer) 15.5; /* result => int */
// as we say before we change the data with our selves
echo 5.5 + 5.5 ; /*result is 11 but data type here is a double */
// to make it an int => echo (int) 5.5 + (int) 5.5
