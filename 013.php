<?php /*var and naming rules*/
// var in php start with dollar sign $
/* for e.g*/ $variable1 = "anything"
// var nerver start with integer [0.1.2.3.4...]
// you can start your var with "_" | underscore | sign or any latter [a to z or A to Z]
// we can use numbers inside the var

  ============================
  ====loosely typed language==
    In computer programming, loosely typed languages are those that allow for
    variables to hold values of different data types during the program's execution without the need
    to explicitly declare the data type of the variable.
    In other words, loosely typed languages allow the programmer to assign a value to a variable without
    explicitly specifying the data type of the variable, and the language will automatically determine the
    appropriate data type based on the value assigned. For example, in a loosely typed language like JavaScript,
    a variable can hold a string value at one point in time, and a numeric value at another point in time.
    This is in contrast to strongly typed languages, where variables must be declared with a specific data type and
    cannot be changed during program execution. In a strongly typed language like Java, for example, you must declare the
    variable type explicitly, and a variable that is declared as an integer cannot hold a string value.
    While loosely typed languages offer flexibility and can be easier to write code in, they can also lead
    to errors that may be difficult to debug. In contrast, strongly typed languages can help catch errors
    earlier in the development process, but may require more effort to write code.
